	<h1>Junior Year (2020-2021)</h1>

	<h2>First Semester</h2>
		<p>UW re-opened to students for the Fall Semester, with restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. I moved into a new apartment closer to the downtown area! Here is a photo of my roommates and I.</p>

		<p>Game days were a little different than normal this year, since fans were not allowed into the stadium. My friends in my immediate circle still decided to dress up and watch the games together!</p>
